# Text analysis of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 

I am currently taking the course [Effective Data Visualization: Transform Information into Art](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3069-effective-data-visualization-transform-information-into-art) with [Sonja Kuijpers](http://www.studioterp.nl), a brilliant Data Illustrator. Our project is to create a visualization with a book as the topic. 

In order to avoid copyright issues, we were encouraged to source texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) (which you should definitely check out!) I chose Lewis Carroll’s 1865 children’s novel *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. As a kid, I loved it so much, and then as an English major at UMBC I studied it in a course, so I am excited to viz it. 

Although the dataviz course is focused on manually harvesting data (which I am doing with the film adaptations), I chose to do the analysis of the actual text in Python with the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) Python library (and, of course, pandas, NumPy, etc).

I’m documenting my progress here.
